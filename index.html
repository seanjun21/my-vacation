	<h1 class="important">My Vacation...</h1>
		<p>
			For our anniversary, <b>Sora</b>(<em>my wife</em>), and I decided to go on post-wedding honeymoon trip that we forgot about for long time. Since, we are both big football(soccer) fans, we decided to visit some of <em><b>The Best Football Stadiums in Europe</b></em>. Tag along, I will show you how it went...

	<h2 id="campnou">Camp Nou: Barcelona, Spain</h2>
		<img src="http://media1.fcbarcelona.com/media/asset_publics/resources/000/034/584/size_640x360/640x360_camp_nou.v1353400161.jpg">
		<p>
			For our first trip, we visited Camp Nou of Barcelona. This stadium has been the home of <em><b>FC Barcelona</b></em> <!-- The team that we LOVE -->since 1957. It has a seating capacity of 99,354 (largest in Spain by capacity). It is also the largest stadium in Europe and the second largest association football stadium in the world in terms of capacity. When we visited they had a <em><b>Copa Del Rey Final</b></em> match versus <em><b>Athletic Bilbao</b></em>. Barcelona beat them 3-1, so it was worth watching.

			Stadium atmosphere was absolutely 'Electric' when <em><b>Lionel Messi</b></em> scored this wonderful goal.

	<h2 id="oldtraf">Old Trafford: Manchester, England</h2>
		<img src="http://www.stadiumguide.com/wp-content/gallery/oldtrafford/oldtrafford8.jpg">
		<p>
			Old Trafford is a football stadium in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, and the home of <em><b>Manchester United</b></em>. With a capacity of 75,635, it is the largest club stadium of any football team in the United Kingdom, the third-largest stadium and the second-largest football stadium in the United Kingdom, and the eleventh-largest in Europe. So you guessed it. It is pretty big. <!-- Maybe not as big as Camp Nou. -->I have been United supporter for long time, and it never seize to amaze me how beautiful this stadium is.

			While we were there, United payed tribute before match to a great legend, <em><b>Bruce Lee</b></em>. It was nice to see him throwing nunchuks at the screen (most unlikely place?)
		</p>
		<br>
	<h2>San Siro: Milan, Italy</h2>
		<img src="http://www.milanocard.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Stadio-di-San-Siro1.jpg">
		<p>
			The Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, commonly known as San Siro, is a football stadium in the San Siro district of Milan, Italy, which is the home of <em><b>A.C. Milan</b></em> and <em><b>Inter Milan</b></em>. It has an all-seater capacity of 80,018, making it one of the largest stadiums in Europe, and the largest in Italy. This stadium will host the <em><b>2016 UEFA Champions League Final</b></em>, so we had to visit this place. They were already getting prepared for final (happening in less than 2 months). I cannot wait to watch the final this year, it's going to be great!
